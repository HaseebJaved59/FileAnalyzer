Deep learning (DL) has been proven to be very effective in processing large amounts of data, extracting features, and eventually making decisions. With the help of DL techniques, many applications related to medical imaging can be applied [4-6]. Medical imaging is the visual representation of human organs, which will be very helpful in the early detection and diagnosis of diseases. Medical images are known to generate a large amount of data, and experts may need to analyze every image to make an accurate diagnosis for the patient. Given the large number of medical images that need to be analyzed, it can be time-consuming for the medical staff to study each image and give a correct diagnosis. When a large amount of medical imaging data is given to a DL machine, the machine can assist experts in making decisions and learning about different features in an image without human intervention [7-8]. Sometimes, it can be a challenge for experts to distinguish similar patterns associated with a disease, and it can lead to a false diagnosis. However, with advanced technology, these patterns can be discriminated against easily when the machine extracts the different features on an image, learn the patterns, and classify them. As a result, the machine can then make predictions with high accuracy, leading to an accurate diagnosis. Convolutional neural network (CNN) is one of the many examples of DL techniques that can achieve high accuracy on classification and image recognition problems. The CNN-based model would need to be provided with a large dataset consisting of labeled medical images. This dataset is usually split into two parts, where the first is used for training and the second is used for testing. An advantage of such a model is its speed in processing large data and making decisions way beyond human ability. In the medical field, the speed of analysis and, eventually, early prediction is a very crucial factor in saving patientsâ€™ lives.
